 Deploying a Dockerized Vue.js Application to AWS ECS Using GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

🎯 Task Subject
CI/CD for a Dockerized Frontend App

🧩 Objective
Set up a full CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds a Vue.js application, packages it as a Docker image, pushes it to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and deploys it to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) using GitHub Actions.

- Set Up the Project
- Create a basic Vue.js app using Vite or Vue CLI.
- Ensure it runs locally (npm run dev).
- Dockerize the App
- Write a multi-stage Dockerfile to:
- Build the Vue.js app
- Serve it using Nginx in production
- Push Docker Image to AWS ECR
- Tag the Docker image
- Push it to ECR using AWS CLI or via GitHub Actions
- Deploy to AWS ECS
- Ensure the ECS service uses the new image
- Force a new deployment via the pipeline
- Automate the Process
- Create a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml) that:
- Installs dependencies
- Builds the Vue app
- Builds the Docker image
- Pushes it to ECR
- Triggers ECS deployment

🔒 Required GitHub Secrets
In the GitHub repo, configure the following under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
